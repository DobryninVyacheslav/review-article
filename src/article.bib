@book{manning2008introduction,
    abstract = {Class-tested and coherent, this textbook teaches classical and web informatio
    retrieval, including web search and the related areas of text classification and text
    clustering from basic concepts. It gives an up-to-date treatment of all aspects of the design
 and implementation of systems for gathering, indexing, and searching documents; methods for
    evaluating systems; and an introduction to the use of machine learning methods on text
    collections. All the important ideas are explained using examples and figures, making it
    perfect for introductory courses in information retrieval for advanced undergraduates and
    graduate students in computer science. Based on feedback from extensive classroom experience,
 the book has been carefully structured in order to make teaching more natural and effective.},
